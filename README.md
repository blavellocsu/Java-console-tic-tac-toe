# Java-console-tic-tac-toe
A simple Java Console-based Tic Tac Toe game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game using a main file and a class.  The Main file creates a new Game_Board object, and reads input.  
It also loops through the game (including looping back when bad input is provided) and prompts the user for input each time.

The Game_Board class is the base for the Game Board and game logicâ€” it initializes a new board at the beginning with the default constructor.  The Game_Board class prints the board, keeps track of moves made, checks for draws and wins, places the player move on the board, and as well checks to make sure the move is legal before placing it on the board.
